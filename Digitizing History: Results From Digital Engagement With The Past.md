# Digitizing History: Results From Digital Engagement With The Past

## Introduction

In our first module for this course, our group (consisting of myself and my partner Margaret) chose to scan a replica of an ancient Egyptian statue of a hippopotamus, often known by the nickname "William". We used the app Scann3D to construct a 3D model of this replica, creating an imperfect digital replica of our imperfect replica of the statue.

In our second module, we attempted to "mash up" our 3D model with another by placing it in a scene facing a model of the Ishtar Gate. We used the program Meshmixer to accomplish the task. Unfortunately, it did not go quite as planned, since textures could not be found for the Ishtar Gate and the textures present in our original model disappeared when we exported the file, making the objects of the scene difficult to recognize - both appeared as textureless shapes.

For our third module, we created a Twine game based around a fictionalized archaeological narrative in which the original William statue was unearthed. The game took significant creative liberties with the object's "true" history, but allowed the player to explore the history of the object from a variety of narrative angles.

Finally, we attempted to create an augmented reality representation of our model for the last module. Our representation was created using HP Reveal and employed both the model we created in the first module and a modified version with three of the legs removed. Ideally, the viewer would be able to toggle between views of the two models to see what the statue might have looked like when it was excavated, as it was found with three of its legs broken off (which were later restored). Unfortunately, this module was not entirely successful as we could not find a way to get HP Reveal to recognize the model's textures, which resulted in the model displaying on the screen as a textureless mass - neither version of the statue was particularly recognizable.

In this portfolio, I will explore some of the issues that occurred throughout the various modules. I will also explore what our processes taught me about the general practice of digitizing historical artifacts. I learned about a kind of distortion that appears to be inevitable when working with new technologies. I also learned which tools were more useful for digitizing history compared to others. I found economic and copyright issues throughout our processes which proved to be hindrances. Finally, while I found many of the readings on the philosophical perspectives concerning the nature of the "original" object fascinating, they turned out to be more interesting from a purely theoretical viewpoint - partially because of our temporal and economic constraints we faced from working on these projects as part of a semester-long course.

## Digital History Often Involves Distortion

Frequently, our projects for each module were distorted in some way at the point of their "final" versions. As mentioned in the introduction, 3D models often lacked textures that allowed them to be recognizeable objects, but there were further issues: our very first 3D model had strange "chunks" missing from its edges and "holes that were present; the model went through a series of scaling modifications to ensure it was even visible; the model's quality had to be reduced in order for HP Reveal to allow it to be uploaded in the first place. All these changes ended up distorting the appearance of the object we were working with.

The most obvious source of these distortions would be the limitations we had surrounding our own technological competence, as well as the limited availability of various technologies to achieve our purposes. Neither of our group members had much experience in working with coding or 3D modelling prior to the beginning of the class. This became a source of slowed progress during the making of the Twine game, as several story nodes failed to connect to each other for seemingly inexplicable reasons. We also had no idea as to what methods could be used to restore the textures to our models in the cases that they were lost; we frequently deferred to the professor for help in these circumstances. I am, in this respect, happy that we kept an open record of our process notes; if someone more experienced were attempting to repeat our processes, they might be able to see where we went wrong in our efforts and as a result, have more success in their own endeavors.

We only had access to limited technologies during our modules, which further affected our ability to represent our object in the ways we wanted to. Our first experiments with constructing the 3D model made use of the program Regard3D and the app Scann3D, the latter being employed to create the final version of the model for that module. These, however, were photogrammetry programs that were relatively limited in their capabilities. With more professional programs, we could potentially have created more coherent models - but of course we did not have access to these.

Another issue we faced in terms of processes that distorted our module outcomes was the dilemma of distortions in objects that we allowed for the sake of "convenience". One such example of this can be found in the narrative of our Twine game: we took a number of creative liberties with the history the game presents in terms of the archaeological excavation of the statue. We took these liberties mainly for the purposes of creating an experience for the player that would allow them to see the possible historical realities the object could have faced, creating an "active multilinear nodal narrative" (Copplestone, T. and Dunne, D. 2017). While this approach was effective in achieving our purposes for the module, they did end up "distorting" the presentation of the history within the narrative. Players could potentially be misled to believe that our fictionalized narrative was a "true history" of the object it concerned.

We made a number of assumptions about the origins and purposes of our statue that could potentially also have distorted our presentations of it. During the making of the Twine game, we reflected on how well we truly knew the history of the object we had centred our game around, given a lack of proper historical sources concerning this (for a full discussion of these reflections, see our research note: https://github.com/KurtGrunsky/hist3812-example-repo-for-artifact/blob/master/notes-on-research-module-3/research-notes-module-3.md). In the final module, we considered the fact that we may be enforcing a kind of unintentional "digital colonialism" through our focus on an object's being that centred largely around its "pre-" and "post-excavated" status (the digital colonialism discussion being sparked by the following article: http://www.factumfoundation.org/pag/236/).

We built our Aura and Twine narrative largely around assumptions of the object's "use" within its original context. As Ian Hodder notes in his book *Entangled*, a "thing" tends to require some sort of context of other things and knowledge of them that surround it in order to make its use more clear (Hodder 3). We had been working from assumptions based on not-especially-reliable sources that the "use" of our object was tied to its placement in the tomb chapel it was discovered in, potentially intended to allow for a sort of "safe passage to the afterlife" of the deceased (for a more complete discussion of this, see our research note from the final module: https://github.com/KurtGrunsky/hist3812-example-repo-for-artifact/blob/master/notes-on-research-module-4/notes-on-research-module-4.md). Lacking definitive sources on the original use of the object, however, we may have significantly distorted its purpose.

Nevertheless, we would not have been the first to incur such distortions. Hodder describes a process of producing and reproducing things for a variety of uses in conjunction with other things and knowledges (Hodder 42-43). Contrasting with our digital "reproductions" of the statue, those who originally "produced" the statue after its excavation for display purposes re-attached (or "restored" in some manner - research did not clarify this for us) the statue's legs. This involved a specific synthesis of knowledge and other materials to put the statue to a new use: that of a cultural artifact intended for display rather than a symbolic marker for a spiritual journey (assuming this was the statue's original purpose at all). Thus the statue was, in some way, already "distorted" before we even began our attempts at digitally reproducing it.

## Money And Copyright Issues Were (And Will Likely Continue To Be) Limiting Factors

Economic and legal barriers were the cause of at least a few problems throughout the various modules. In terms of monetary problems, I mentioned in the previous section that we only had access to the most basic-level programs with which to complete the modules for most projects. While this was not a terrible problem because a number of open-source softwares still allowed us to meet our relatively-low (and non-professional) standards for our projects, it became a slight source of anxiety at times. In the very first module, our group made use of the Scann3D photogrammetry app to construct our 3D model. This app, however, would only allow for a brief free trial period in which we could export the models we created. If I had not cancelled the app's registration for this period before it was over, I would have been charged (what I consider to be) an unreasonable monthly fee to keep the app. This also meant that we had to make sure we were satisfied with the initial model we were able to construct with the app before exporting it, since we would't get another chance to remake it later without paying. This was a somewhat frustrating experience, and it was only for a very basic consumer-grade app; I can imagine anyone trying to meet more professional standards would suffer far higher economic barriers to even begin their projects.

Copyright and ownership problems also played a role in our modules. During our second module, it turned out to be difficult to find a 3D model of the Ishtar Gate that could be downloaded. One that we found on Sketchfab did not allow for downloads, and the one that we ended up using had no textures on it (though this turned out to be less of a problem than we expected, considering that our "mesh" of the two models didn't include any textures, inexplicably). I suspect this lack of availability of 3D models of the gate is potentially due to the fact that part of the gate is in possession of the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. The museum could very well be restricting access to scanned models of its artifacts, just as the same city's Neues Museum kept a tight hold on its 3D scans of the bust of Nefertiti. This might explain why we were only able to obtain imperfect models of the gate for our own use.

Speaking of imperfect models, our original model of the hippo statue had significant differences from its original source mainly because we scanned a replica of it rather than the original statue - the original statue being too difficult for us to get to in time. Additionally, I am not sure we would necessarily have been allowed to scan the original statue even if we were able to see it in-person; if it is kept under strict copyright or ownership by the museum as the Ishtar Gate might have been, it's quite possible that this replica we scanned was the best opportunity we would have to reproduce a of 3D model of its source. Thus we our projects were limited by the availability of a number of source materials in addition to the limitations caused by potential expenses.

## Some Digital History Tools Were More Useful Than Others - At Least For Our Purposes

We learned no shortage of methods to assist us with our projects in class, and many of these methods made use of a great variety of digital tools. Not all of these tools lived up to their promises, though - or at least not within the scope of the projects we worked on. In an initial experiment using Regard 3D to attempt to build our 3D model, we found that the program did not function well with the technologies we had available; it required an image file with the camera's "focal length" data, which isn't available on pictures taken with most phone cameras. We were taught a method using exiftool to add the focal lengths, but after several attempts to get Regard 3D to accept the files, the best we were able to come up with remained an incredibly fragmented model compared to what Scann3D could produce. It is hard to know whether this issue was caused by problems in Regard 3D, exiftool or the hardware we had available (my computer/phone). Though these tools ultimately did not prove useful for our purposes given the issue that occurred, our documenting of the issue in our process notes could potentially inspire someone else to try to fix the problem through their own attempts to work with them.

Further, I was somewhat disappointed in the "distant reading" processes provided through voyant tools, databasic.io and other such sites. These seemed to have potential to draw interesting patterns out of larger amounts of text that might help us find insights about our own projects, but I can't honestly say that I drew anything useful out of experimenting with it in the end. One reason for this is perhaps the fact that we were trying to synthesize information from many different groups working on drastically different projects within a class that changed weekly discussion topics quite quickly throughout the semester; if the class had been more unified and slower-paced, it's possible more recognizeable patterns could have emerged from using "distant reading" methods on our collected notes and work. As it was, the day when we attempted to make Twine games based on a neural network's extrapolations from our notes was fun and a good way to learn how to program Twine, but the game it yielded (at least in my experience) was ultimately incomprehensible. This is not to say that these tools might not be useful to another person - once again, I suspect that the setting and type of work being done could result in quite different (and possibly more comprehensible) patterns drawn from ditant reading techniques. Within our own projects, however, I could not find a place for it.

## Concepts And Their Relation To Our Work
### The Questions Surrounding The "Original" Were Mainly Interesting From A Philosophical Perspective

We looked at a number of fascinating theoretical works discussing the philosophy of digitizing history and the conflicts surrounding the concept of the "original". While these were useful in writing our paradata to discuss the theoretical implications of the work we were doing (particularly Latour and Lowe's article on the "cornucopia" brought about through reproduction), most discussions that centred on the "originality" of the object proved to be somewhat inconsequential to our project - they did not have any particular material effect on our process.

My guess as to why this was the case is that we were not working on a level of reproduction that truly "threatened the original" in any meaningful way. We were working, from the very beginning, with an imperfect replica of a statue, so our 3D model would hardly have been considered an "equivalent" reproduction to the "original". Further, we positioned our Twine game as a fictional narrative (so as not to threaten the "truth" of the object's history) and admitted the speculative nature of our final module's assumptions. The flaws in our object would be more likely to draw attention to the technology we used to reproduce it rather than the "authenticity" of that object in the face of the "original".

### The Question Of "Ownership" Could Have Been Explored Further

This being said, my last statement in the previous paragraph is also speculation; since our projects probably didn't reach much of an audience beyond the class, I can't be sure that the Metropolitan Museum of Art wouldn't contest the legality of our reproductions if it knew about them. This leads me to consider another topic that I worry was not covered enough in the class discussions: the issue of ownership. While it was mentioned a few times (and did come up in the readings - David Gunkel's article on remixes, Sam Jacob's on copies and the article on the Palmyra Arch come to mind), I feel like we did not consider the implications of this topic enough, considering that I expect it may be one of the single biggest factors in terms of limiting what can be legally and ethically done with digitizing history. Discussions of ownership always seemed to halt too soon - as if we would reach a point in the discussion where we were unsure of what could be done about issues within it.

Paul Reilly's article on the casts of bodies buried in Pompeii was probably the most thorough investigation into this concept of ownership; it asked difficult questions about whether or not a reproduction of a body is still a body, whether a body can be an "artifact", and if so, whether that "artifact" can be owned (Reilly). The ethical stakes on our project were admittedly lower, but it might have been interesting to apply this concept more to discussions of what we were doing. Admittedly, we could have chosen to discuss this article more in-depth in our paradata and chose not to. However, I believe this is also partially because our discussion would only have resulted in a further lack of answers concerning what we could be held responsible for ethically or legally in terms of our own reproductions.

Digitizing historical objects clearly brings in a tangled web of ethical and legal implications. Ian Hodder claims that questions of ownership are important because they help to structure societies; our participation in the production and consumption of things owned by others and ourselves forms the basis for such structuring (Hodder 26). As this ownership becomes an integral embedded part of the networks of things (and our dependencies on them), individuals' ownerships of individual things will change over time, as well as the relationships of things to other things (Hodder 44). Through a lens such as this, we might have better examined what implications our treatment of the ownership of the object in question would have for society as a whole - say, if other things were treated in a similar manner of ownership. If I could return to various stages in the modules, I might have spent more time in our paradata investigating sch questions.
