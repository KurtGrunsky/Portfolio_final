# Digitizing History: Results From Digital Engagement With The Past

## Introduction

In our first module for this course, our group (consisting of myself and my partner Margaret) chose to scan a replica of an ancient Egyptian statue of a hippopotamus, often known by the nickname "William". We used the app Scann3D to construct a 3D model of this replica, creating an imperfect digital replica of our imperfect replica of the statue.

In our second module, we attempted to "mash up" our 3D model with another by placing it in a scene facing a model of the Ishtar Gate. We used the program Meshmixer to accomplish the task. Unfortunately, it did not go quite as planned, since textures could not be found for the Ishtar Gate and the textures present in our original model disappeared when we exported the file, making the objects of the scene difficult to recognize - both appeared as textureless shapes.

For our third module, we created a Twine game based around a fictionalized archaeological narrative in which the original William statue was unearthed. The game took significant creative liberties with the object's "true" history, but allowed the player to explore the history of the object from a variety of narrative angles.

Finally, we attempted to create an augmented reality representation of our model for the last module. Our representation was created using HP Reveal and employed both the model we created in the first module and a modified version with three of the legs removed. Ideally, the viewer would be able to toggle between views of the two models to see what the statue might have looked like when it was excavated, as it was found with three of its legs broken off (which were later restored). Unfortunately, this module was not entirely successful as we could not find a way to get HP Reveal to recognize the model's textures, which resulted in the model displaying on the screen as a textureless mass - neither version of the statue was particularly recognizable.

The results of each of these modules can be found below:

In this portfolio, I will explore some of the issues that occurred throughout the various modules. I will also explore what our processes taught me about the general practice of digitizing historical artifacts. I learned about a kind of distortion that appears to be inevitable when working with new technologies. I also learned which tools were more useful for digitizing history compared to others. I found economic and copyright issues throughout our processes which proved to be hindrances. Finally, while I found many of the readings on the philosophical perspectives concerning the nature of the "original" object fascinating, they turned out to be more interesting from a purely theoretical viewpoint - partially because of our temporal and economic constraints we faced from working on these projects as part of a semester-long course.
