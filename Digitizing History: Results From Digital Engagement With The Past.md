# Digitizing History: Results From Digital Engagement With The Past

## Introduction

In our first module for this course, our group (consisting of myself and my partner Margaret) chose to scan a replica of an ancient Egyptian statue of a hippopotamus, often known by the nickname "William". We used the app Scann3D to construct a 3D model of this replica, creating an imperfect digital replica of our imperfect replica of the statue.

In our second module, we attempted to "mash up" our 3D model with another by placing it in a scene facing a model of the Ishtar Gate. We used the program Meshmixer to accomplish the task. Unfortunately, it did not go quite as planned, since textures could not be found for the Ishtar Gate and the textures present in our original model disappeared when we exported the file, making the objects of the scene difficult to recognize - both appeared as textureless shapes.

For our third module, we created a Twine game based around a fictionalized archaeological narrative in which the original William statue was unearthed. The game took significant creative liberties with the object's "true" history, but allowed the player to explore the history of the object from a variety of narrative angles.

Finally, we attempted to create an augmented reality representation of our model for the last module. Our representation was created using HP Reveal and employed both the model we created in the first module and a modified version with three of the legs removed. Ideally, the viewer would be able to toggle between views of the two models to see what the statue might have looked like when it was excavated, as it was found with three of its legs broken off (which were later restored). Unfortunately, this module was not entirely successful as we could not find a way to get HP Reveal to recognize the model's textures, which resulted in the model displaying on the screen as a textureless mass - neither version of the statue was particularly recognizable.

In this portfolio, I will explore some of the issues that occurred throughout the various modules. I will also explore what our processes taught me about the general practice of digitizing historical artifacts. I learned about a kind of distortion that appears to be inevitable when working with new technologies. I also learned which tools were more useful for digitizing history compared to others. I found economic and copyright issues throughout our processes which proved to be hindrances. Finally, while I found many of the readings on the philosophical perspectives concerning the nature of the "original" object fascinating, they turned out to be more interesting from a purely theoretical viewpoint - partially because of our temporal and economic constraints we faced from working on these projects as part of a semester-long course.

## Digital History Often Involves Distortion

Frequently, our projects for each module were distorted in some way at the point of their "final" versions. As mentioned in the introduction, 3D models often lacked textures that allowed them to be recognizeable objects, but there were further issues: our very first 3D model had strange "chunks" missing from its edges and "holes that were present; the model went through a series of scaling modifications to ensure it was even visible; the model's quality had to be reduced in order for HP Reveal to allow it to be uploaded in the first place. All these changes ended up distorting the appearance of the object we were working with.

The most obvious source of these distortions would be the limitations we had surrounding our own technological competence, as well as the limited availability of various technologies to achieve our purposes. Neither of our group members had much experience in working with coding or 3D modelling prior to the beginning of the class. This became a source of slowed progress during the making of the Twine game, as several story nodes failed to connect to each other for seemingly inexplicable reasons. We also had no idea as to what methods could be used to restore the textures to our models in the cases that they were lost; we frequently deferred to the professor for help in these circumstances.

We only had access to limited technologies during our modules, which further affected our ability to represent our object in the ways we wanted to. Our first experiments with constructing the 3D model made use of the program Regard3D and the app Scann3D, the latter being employed to create the final version of the model for that module. These, however, were photogrammetry programs that were relatively limited in their capabilities. With more professional programs, we could potentially have created more coherent models - but of course we did not have access to these.

Another issue we faced in terms of processes that distorted our module outcomes was the dilemma of distortions in objects that we allowed for the sake of "convenience". One such example of this can be found in the narrative of our Twine game: we took a number of creative liberties with the history the game presents in terms of the archaeological excavation of the statue. We took these liberties mainly for the purposes of creating an experience for the player that would allow them to see the possible historical realities the object could have faced, creating an "active multilinear nodal narrative" (Copplestone, T. and Dunne, D. 2017). While this approach was effective in achieving our purposes for the module, they did end up "distorting" the presentation of the history within the narrative. Players could potentially be misled to believe that our fictionalized narrative was a "true history" of the object it concerned.

We made a number of assumptions about the origins and purposes of our statue that could potentially also have distorted our presentations of it. During the making of the Twine game, we reflected on how well we truly knew the history of the object we had centred our game around, given a lack of proper historical sources concerning this (for a full discussion of these reflections, see our research note: https://github.com/KurtGrunsky/hist3812-example-repo-for-artifact/blob/master/notes-on-research-module-3/research-notes-module-3.md). In the final module, we considered the fact that we may be enforcing a kind of unintentional "digital colonialism" through our focus on an object's being that centred largely around its "pre-" and "post-excavated" status (the digital colonialism discussion being sparked by the following article: http://www.factumfoundation.org/pag/236/).

We built our Aura and Twine narrative largely around assumptions of the object's "use" within its original context. As Ian Hodder notes in his book *Entangled*, a "thing" tends to require some sort of context of other things and knowledge of them that surround it in order to make its use more clear (Hodder 3). We had been working from assumptions based on not-especially-reliable sources that the "use" of our object was tied to its placement in the tomb chapel it was discovered in, potentially intended to allow for a sort of "safe passage to the afterlife" of the deceased (for a more complete discussion of this, see our research note from the final module: https://github.com/KurtGrunsky/hist3812-example-repo-for-artifact/blob/master/notes-on-research-module-4/notes-on-research-module-4.md). Lacking definitive sources on the original use of the object, however, we may have significantly distorted its purpose.

Nevertheless, we would not have been the first to incur such distortions. Hodder describes a process of producing and reproducing things for a variety of uses in conjunction with other things and knowledges (Hodder 42-43). Contrasting with our digital "reproductions" of the statue, those who originally "produced" the statue after its excavation for display purposes re-attached (or "restored" in some manner - research did not clarify this for us) the statue's legs. This involved a specific synthesis of knowledge and other materials to put the statue to a new use: that of a cultural artifact intended for display rather than a symbolic marker for a spiritual journey (assuming this was the statue's original purpose at all). Thus the statue was, in some way, already "distorted" before we even began our attempts at digitally reproducing it.
